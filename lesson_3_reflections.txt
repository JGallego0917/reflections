When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working as a group or need others information. Creates a back up if computer is gone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might have things set up differently. YOu might have named things differently.
	You could also be in a state of change that is not ready to be pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a clone on GitHub only. It clones and links to the original repository.
	Clones are copies of repositories. Clones are possible from remote to local,
	local to remote, and local to local but not remote to remote in GitHub. Branches
	are extensions of a repository but not a clone.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you could work offline with the latest changes available. You can also
	see that those changes work with your branches or not. See any changes
	you might not have.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    saving files to a network and only allow one person in at a time. it would
	be easier for things that are not changed very often. It would be harder 
	for things that change more often.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when they are different or experiemental. Benefits would be to reduce putting
	out new changes to master before you are sure they are complete or right.
