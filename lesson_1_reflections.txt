How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    reduced what I had to look through to actual differences in the program.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allows me to use the undo button or see what I changed. lets me restore to 
	a working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manually doing it are knowwing what versions where commited and what
	they are for. Cons of manually is you might forget to commit before breaking things.
	Pros of google are you have lots of commits and back up. Cons don't know which 
	version is what.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because you might have changed multiple files for one single change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can use log to see the changes and diff to see the difference between each 
change.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
